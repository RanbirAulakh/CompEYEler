## Summary 

Analyzes code images of different fonts and different capture environments and converts them to text.

### Objective

The objective of our project is to detect and parse text from images and write the result into text files. The minimum viable product is to be able to interpret mono-spaced, whitespace sensitive images of text into text that a user can compile into a working program.

### Introduction

Have you ever wanted to copy code from an image? Want to collaborate more efficiently? Want to know what kind of language a snippet is in? Look no further! CompEYEler is a computer vision tool that converts code images to text, without you having to transcribe the entire code yourself. CompEYEler will change the way you share code with friends, peers, teammates, and more.
